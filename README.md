# StudentGradePrediction
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the factors influencing student grades using a dataset sourced from a CSV file. The dataset encompasses students from various nationalities and grade levels, incorporating key determinants such as the number of hands raised, attendance records, hours of study, and more.

In the project, diverse classifiers and machine learning models are employed to achieve accurate predictions regarding the factors impacting students' academic performance. Additionally, visual aids, including graphs and confusion matrices, are generated to effectively present and interpret the project results. The objective is to identify and analyze the significant variables that contribute to the grades of students in a comprehensive manner.
